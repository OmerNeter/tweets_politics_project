This folder contains the analytics of users distributions. 
We only include a few datasets in each of the two folders (politics\ disasters) due to space limitation. 
Aditional datasets can be found following the root documentation in the file "DataSources.xlsx".

The politics and the disasters folders under this directory include some of the data sets.
The .ipynb file contains the code to analyse the hashtags.
