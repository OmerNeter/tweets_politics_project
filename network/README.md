The structure to construct the network is illustrated in the article in Fig 1. 
The **graph** subfolders, contains some of the graphs (not all could be uploaded due to space lmits) as .graphml files. These can be opened with any graphs software such as Gephi, R or Python. 

The different network structures are computed for each network.
In the **Politics directory**, we present the degree distribution of the bibabrtitie network of the political tipics, and in the **Disasters directory**, the degree distribution of the disasters cascades.
