****Network Analysis****

This directory presents the network analisis as a bipartite network.

In this analysis, tweets were connected to words that are appear in each tweet to construct a network.

The illustration of the network construction is shown in the article in Fig 1. 

The **graph** subfolders, contains some of the graphs (not all could be uploaded due to space lmits) as .graphml files. These can be opened with any graphs software such as Gephi, R or Python. 

The different network structures are computed for each network.
In the **politics directory**, we present the degree distribution of the bibabrtitie network of the political tipics, 
and in the **disasters directory**, the degree distribution of the disasters cascades.

The **data points for figure 5** in tha article are found in Fig5.xls file 
Thne code is in the .ipynb code file. 
The code also compure additional network parameters such as number of components, average degree and degree distribution power law slope.
