# Tweets_Politics_Project
This repository includes all code and links to data sets used in the study "“Signals of Propaganda” - Detecting and Estimating Political
Influences in Information Cascades in Social Networks".

There are 3 main directories, 
1. Hashtag analysis. (named hashtags). 
  1.1 distribution of counts of hashtags
  1.2 slopes on log-log scale
  1.3 PLMSE computation.
   
2. Users analysis (named network).
   2.1 distribution of counts of users
   2.2 slopes on log-log scale ( we came into conclusion that the users are NOT distributed by a power law, but it is some type of long tail.
   2.3 PLMSE computation.

3. Network analysis (named network)
The excel table named Network_datasets in the main root directory includes links to all datasets used in the work.
The data from which we constructed the networks was downloaded from 2 different sources.
   3.1 csv files (Kaggle, see link in code)
   3.2 jsonl files (Zubiaga, A. (2018). A longitudinal assessment of the persistence of twitter datasets. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 69(8), 974-984.)

4. images - images produced during the project, not all images are included in the article.

5. All data sources and their links are found in the file named "DataSources.xlsx" in column "J".
   The data sets were first downloaded manually to a local machine, then processed by the ipython code give in each directory.

*** the .ipynb_checkpoints folders are old code, which were not deleted, but generally include code and images that were not the last version used in the manuscript.
